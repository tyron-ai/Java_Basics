we
the people of south africa
declare for all our country and the world to know
that south africa belongs to all who live in it
black and white
and that no government can justly claim authority unless it is based on the will of all the people
that our people have been robbed of their birthright to land and liberty and peace by a form of government founded on injustice and inequality
that our country will never be prosperous or free until all our people live in brotherhood
enjoying equal rights and opportunities
that only a democratic state based on the will of all the people can secure to all their birthright without distinction of colour or race or sex or belief
