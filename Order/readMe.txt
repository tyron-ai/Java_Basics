For each line it will determine the length of the longest sub sequence where the words are in alphabetical order.
Given the line 'the rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain', for example, the longest sub sequence is 'falls mainly on
 the', which is length 4. Given the line 'how now brown cow', it's a tie, the longest sequences are 'how now' and 'brown cow'.
