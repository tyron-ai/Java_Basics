This question concerns comparing a set of cards as part of a card game.

A card has three attributes: a shape (square or circle or triangle), a colour (blue or red or green) and a pattern (spot or solid or stripe).
Two cards are distinct if they do not have the same shape or colour or pattern i.e. none of their attributes match.
Two cards are the same if they have the same shape and colour and pattern i.e. all their attributes match.
A set of three cards is valid if it consists of (i) three distinct cards, or (ii) three of the same card.
